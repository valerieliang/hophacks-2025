# MoveQuest

## Overview

MoveQuest is a gamified physical therapy app designed for children and teens recovering from injury, surgery, etc. The app turns often repetitive or boring physical therapy exercises into engaging challenges and adventures, helping young users stay motivated and consistent with their therapy routines.

## Why This Matters

Traditional physical therapy exercises can feel monotonous, especially for young patients who may not yet understand the long-term benefits. By introducing game mechanics, rewards, and adventure-based goals, MoveQuest encourages regular participation, leading to faster progress, better adherence, and more enjoyable recovery experiences.

## Benefits

- Increases motivation and consistency in therapy routines.
